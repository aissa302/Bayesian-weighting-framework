"sprintf in the GNU C Library (glibc) 2.37 has a buffer overflow (out-of-bounds write) in some situations with a correct buffer size. This is unrelated to CWE-676. It may write beyond the bounds of the destination buffer when attempting to write a padded, thousands-separated string representation of a number, if the buffer is allocated the exact size required to represent that number as a string. For example, 1,234,567 (with padding to 13) overflows by two bytes.",esv
"An issue was discovered in the GNU C Library (glibc) 2.36. When the syslog function is passed a crafted input string larger than 1024 bytes, it reads uninitialized memory from the heap and prints it to the target log file, potentially revealing a portion of the contents of the heap.",esv
A flaw was found in glibc. An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd() in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.,esv
"A flaw was found in glibc. The realpath() function can mistakenly return an unexpected value, potentially leading to information leakage and disclosure of sensitive data.",esv
"When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle previously was used to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent `POST` request. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is changed from a PUT to a POST.",esv
cfg_tilde_expand in confuse.c in libConfuse 3.3 has a heap-based buffer over-read.,esv
"When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle previously was used to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent `POST` request. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is changed from a PUT to a POST.",esv
"An allocation of resources without limits or throttling vulnerability exists in curl <v7.88.0 based on the chained HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a server response can be compressed multiple times and potentially with differentalgorithms. The number of acceptable links in this decompression chain wascapped, but the cap was implemented on a per-header basis allowing a maliciousserver to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply byusing many headers. The use of such a decompression chain could result in a malloc bomb, making curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to and returning out of memory errors.",esv
"A cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability exists in curl <v7.88.0 that could cause HSTS functionality to behave incorrectly when multiple URLs are requested in parallel. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This HSTS mechanism would however surprisingly fail when multiple transfers are done in parallel as the HSTS cache file gets overwritten by the most recentlycompleted transfer. A later HTTP-only transfer to the earlier host name would then *not* get upgraded properly to HSTS.",esv
"curl before 7.86.0 has a double free. If curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-HTTP(S) URL, it sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a CONNECT request to the proxy, and then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200 status code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double free in curl if one of the following schemes were used in the URL for the transfer: dict, gopher, gophers, ldap, ldaps, rtmp, rtmps, or telnet. The earliest affected version is 7.77.0.",esv
"The curl URL parser wrongly accepts percent-encoded URL separators like '/'when decoding the host name part of a URL, making it a *different* URL usingthe wrong host name when it is later retrieved.For example, a URL like `http://example.com%2F127.0.0.1/`, would be allowed bythe parser and get transposed into `http://example.com/127.0.0.1/`. This flawcan be used to circumvent filters, checks and more.",esv
A insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability in fixed in curl 7.83.0 might leak authentication or cookie header data on HTTP redirects to the same host but another port number.,esv
An information disclosure vulnerability exists in curl 7.65.0 to 7.82.0 are vulnerable that by using an IPv6 address that was in the connection pool but with a different zone id it could reuse a connection instead.,esv
An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in curl 4.9 to and include curl 7.82.0 are affected that could allow an attacker to extract credentials when follows HTTP(S) redirects is used with authentication could leak credentials to other services that exist on different protocols or port numbers.,esv
A user controlled parameter related to SMTP test functionality is not correctly validated making it possible to bypass blocked network recipients.,esv
User controlled parameters related to SMTP notifications are not correctly validated. This can lead to a buffer overflow resulting in crashes and data leakage.,esv
"A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s Ext4 File System in how a user triggers several file operations simultaneously with the overlay FS usage. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. Only if patch 9a2544037600 (ovl: fix use after free in struct ovl_aio_req) not applied yet, the kernel could be affected.",esv
An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3. lib/seq_buf.c has a seq_buf_putmem_hex buffer overflow.,esv

a flaw was later found in glibc. an off - once by - one buffer overflow and underflow in individual getcwd ( ) files may lead to memory level corruption just when the buffer size average of the buffer is exactly 1. a local attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd ( ) in a setuid program could use this flaw to possibly potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the host system.,ambiguous
also a particular flaw was found in glibc. an off - by - one buffer overflow problem and underflow in run getcwd ( ) may lead directly to memory corruption when the size of already the buffer is exactly 1. a local attacker mechanism who can control the input buffer and size passed to run getcwd ( ) in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute yet arbitrary code and escalate both their privileges on the system.,ambiguous
a flaw was previously found in glibc. an off - by - one or buffer overflow and underflow flaw in getcwd ( ) may lead eventually to memory corruption when the size of in the buffer is exactly 1. a local attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd ( ) processes in a local setuid program environment could possibly use this flaw to potentially malicious execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.,ambiguous
a flaw once was found in glibc. breaking an off - by - one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd ( ) may each lead thus to memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. a local attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed on to getcwd ( ) installed in a multiple setuid program loop could use this additional flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the running system.,ambiguous
a flaw was previously found in glibc. an off - by - one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd ( ) may lead to memory corruption again when when the size of the buffer buffer is exactly 1. a single local memory attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd ( ) in a setuid exchange program could use this flaw to potentially only execute arbitrary code and escalate their memory privileges on the local system.,ambiguous
a particular flaw that was found in glibc. an off - by - one buffer buffer overflow and data underflow in getcwd ( ) may lead to memory corruption when the size set of the buffer is exactly 1. a local network attacker who can control the input buffer and buffer size passed to getcwd ( ) in a setuid program could use even this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their stored privileges depending on the system.,ambiguous
a flaw also was found in glibc. an early off - by - one buffer overflow error and underflow in getcwd ( ) may lead to memory corruption when the size resolution of the internal buffer bucket is exactly over 1. a local attacker who can not control the input buffer bandwidth and size passed to their getcwd ( ) in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.,ambiguous
a conceptual flaw was later found in glibc. an off - by - one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd ( ) may lead to memory corruption when if the size k of the buffer limit is exactly 1. a local attacker who can control the memory input buffer and size passed to getcwd ( ) running in a setuid program model could use this flaw to further potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate over their privileges on the system.,ambiguous
a flaw was found in glibc. performing an off - by - off one buffer overflow and pointer underflow in getcwd ( ) may lead to additional memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly around 1. thus a specific local native attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd ( ) in a setuid program could use this flaw effectively to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate using their privileges on the system.,ambiguous
a flaw was found in glibc. an interrupt off - by - one buffer using overflow and underflow in getcwd ( ) code may lead to memory corruption when only the maximum size limit of the buffer is exactly 1. and a local attacker who can control what the input address buffer and its size passed to getcwd ( ) in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.,ambiguous
a flaw was found in glibc. an off - by - one random buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd ( ) may lead to memory corruption when when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. a local window attacker who can easily control the input buffer and data size passed to getcwd ( ) in using a windows setuid program could use this flaw to potentially self execute arbitrary code and escalate using their program privileges on the system.,ambiguous
a similar flaw was found in glibc. an off - by - one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd ( ) may lead specifically to memory corruption mainly when typically the size of the target buffer is exactly above 1. a local attacker who nevertheless can control the input buffer and size passed to any getcwd ( ) in a setuid program could then use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their cpu privileges on the system.,ambiguous
previously a flaw instance was found also in glibc. an off - by - one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd ( ) may lead simply to memory corruption when the size of the buffer state is exactly 1. a local database attacker who can control the input buffer and buffer size passed back to some getcwd ( ) in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary machine code and escalate their privileges on the system.,ambiguous
a further flaw also was found in glibc. an off - by - one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd ( ) may lead to memory corruption when the size 0 of the buffer buffer is exactly 1. a single local attacker who first can control the input from buffer and size passed to getcwd ( ) in a setuid program environment could use this software flaw to potentially accidentally execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.,ambiguous
a flaw was found in glibc. an accidental off - by - side one buffer overflow and underflow in one getcwd ( ) may lead to memory corruption when the size of the buffer is at exactly 1. a powerful local network attacker player who can only control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd ( ) in a setuid program could use this flaw intentionally to potentially execute arbitrary malicious code and escalate their privileges on the system.,ambiguous
a flaw was found in glibc. an off - by - one buffer type overflow and queue underflow in the getcwd ( ) may both lead to a memory corruption when the size of the buffer window is exactly 1. a local attacker who previously can control the input buffer and size passed to start getcwd ( ) in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and otherwise escalate their privileges on board the system.,ambiguous
a particular flaw instance was found in glibc. an off - by - one buffer overflow fault and underflow in getcwd ( ) may lead to memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. a remote local attacker operator who can control how the input memory buffer and size passed directly to getcwd ( ) in with a dynamic setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.,ambiguous
similarly a flaw was found in glibc. performing an off - by - on one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd ( ) may lead rapidly to memory corruption when the size of in the buffer is exactly 1. potentially a random local attacker who can not control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd ( ) in a setuid program could use easily this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on even the system.,ambiguous
a flaw found was not found in glibc. an off - by - one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd ( ) may even lead to memory corruption when so the size of only the buffer is exactly... 1. a local attacker who can similarly control the input buffer and size passed in to getcwd ( ) in performing a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges also on the system.,ambiguous
the a flaw was found implemented in performance glibc. blocking an repeated off - by - one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd ( ) memory may lead to memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. a local attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to memory getcwd ( ) in creating a setuid program could then use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code packages and escalate their privileges on the system.,ambiguous
